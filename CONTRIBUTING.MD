# Contributing

Contributions to the computational-linear-algebra.js library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are few preferences regarding code contributions:

- Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
- Before creating a pull request, run the unit tests to make sure the all pass.
- Only commit changes done in the source files under `src`, not to the generated builds
  which are located in the folders `dist` and `lib`.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.

What can I do?

- Search through the issues (if there are any) looking for something that looks interesting to you to pick up. 
 Some issues are marked "help wanted", these are typically issues which should be relatively easy to pick up.

- Complete the todo list. In the main [README](README.md) there is a huge todo list to waiting to be completed!

- Introduce new features. Just come up with a new idea to implement? Code it and create a pull request!


Thanks!
