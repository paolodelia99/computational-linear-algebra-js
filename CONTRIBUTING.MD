# Contributing

Contributions to the computational-linear-algebra.js library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are few preferences regarding code contributions:

- Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
- Before creating a pull request, run the unit tests to make sure the all pass.
- Only commit changes done in the source files under `src`, not to the generated builds
  which are located in the folders `dist` and `lib`.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
